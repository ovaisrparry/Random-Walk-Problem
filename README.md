## Installation

To run this notebook locally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, if you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install Jupyter and the necessary libraries directly:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `Random Walk Problem.ipynb` file in your browser and run the cells.

## Usage

Once you've opened the notebook in Jupyter, you can execute each cell to simulate and visualize the random walk. You can modify parameters such as the number of steps or dimensions directly in the notebook to observe their effects.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the Random Walk Problem and its significance.
2. **Simulation**: Simulates a random walk in one or more dimensions.
3. **Visualization**: Plots the path of the random walk and provides statistical insights.
4. **Analysis**: Presents an analysis of the results, including mean displacement and variance.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the findings of the random walk experiment.

## Dependencies

This notebook requires the following Python packages:
- `numpy` - for numerical computations
